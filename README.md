# Project Link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmedealtwy/sales-analysis

# Summary
in this project, I analyzed sales data from an online retail company. The dataset included information on sales transactions, customer , and popular products.


# Solution
Data Loading and Exploration: I imported necessary Python libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) in a Jupyter Notebook. Then, I loaded the retail dataset, checked for missing values, and explored basic statistics

Data Cleaning: I handled missing data, removed duplicates, and standardized column names.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations (bar plots, line plots, etc.), I examined sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.


# Approach
Time Series Analysis: To understand sales trends over time, I applied time series decomposition and identified seasonal patterns.

Customer Segmentation: group customers based on purchasing behavior.

Product Performance Metrics: I calculated metrics like revenue per product category and identified top-selling items.

Visualization: I created interactive charts (using Matplotlib or Seaborn) to communicate findings effectively.
